## Project ID: CS12
## Project Source: Indigenous Education Foundation
## Project Title: 
Develop Mentawai cultural-based website for Indigenous Education Foundation (IEF)
## Project Description and Scope:
### Context
For almost ten years IEF has partnered with a grassroot Mentawai Foundation, Suku
Mentawai. Supporting a range of cultural-based education projects – many involving extensive
research and documentation of Mentawai’s traditional knowledge – we now seek a common
platform whereby this documentation can be digitally housed, presented and made accessible for
current and future generations.
### Project 
Team to discuss and finalise a design brief provided by IEF, before developing into a
multilayered, professional website for storing / presenting Mentawai’s Indigenous oral literature
documentations. Documentations include image, text, audio and video; thus, integrations to
facilitate are required. Documentations are also to be catalogued into varying types of oral literature
(language, mythology, etc.) and thus clearly presented as such. It is also being discussed that certain
parts of the website will require a login (and potentially payment transaction) to access, which
would require our discussion, planning and execution. Aside from the latter, the website design will
not be overly complex but particular focus is to be given to seamless functionality, clean and
professional appearance, and of course cybersecurity.
*IEF utilises Wordpress and can provide access to Divi templates if deemed suitable.
Students will regularly liaise with project supervisor, Rob Henry, and also obtain guidance and
support from an experienced computer scientist and IT consultant if needed.
## Expected outcomes/deliverables:
Expected outcome is for students to finalise a secure, fully functional, responsive and tested website
to store / present Mentawai’s Indigenous oral literature documentations. IEF will also be provided
with detailed notes instructing use of any complex function used and/or next steps should the
project require final steps for completion. IEF also expect students to gain valuable experience and
expertise for their development and future employment opportunities.
## Specific required knowledge, skills, and/or technology:
Required skillsets for this project include: ability to understand code responsive to all devices -
particularly in html and php, competency in wordpress design, integration of video/audio hosting,
and cybersecurity. IEF also utilise Azure, which may be needed at one of more stages during the
project. An interest in indigenous education and affairs is not required, but certainly looked
favourably upon.
